      4. list buttons aren't working ?
      5. profile - edit profile ? 
4. transaction page - withdrawal & paid , what will go there ?
        1. align - all, withdrawal & paid
5. analytics - will add pie chart on top and then display of daily,
   monthly and yearly expenses 
6. top up screen - idk what's the point of the rounded rectangle and amount 
        buttons color should be lighter , don't want too much color on one page
7. need work on withdrawal page 
8. in qrscan , i was thinking to add those transactions screen for 
   processing and completion  , need a page for adding how much amount to pay
9. if we go back from profile, analytics and transaction screen, 
    it leads to mpin page, change it to homescreen
